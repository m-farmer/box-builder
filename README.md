This project was built with JavaScript, React, and a little Jest & Enzyme.

Set up the code and run it on localhost:3000:

`npm install` <br />
`npm start`


# Requirements met:

## Design:
[x] Drop-down menu with Small, Medium, and Large Subscription Options <br />
[x] List of available products with details <br />
[x] Product details include + / - buttons for quantity <br />
[x] A Save Button (currently does nothing) <br />
[x] Visualization of the Box with a list of products that have been selected (with quantities)

## User Experience:
[x] User must select a subscription before choosing items for the box <br />
[x] User can select one option from the drop-down menu (and can change their minds later) <br />
[x] User will see remaining volume/points available displayed once they make a selection <br />
[x] User can select products by clicking the + / - buttons <br />
[x] The User can't add more than the max volume/value to the box <br />
[x] If the User selects a smaller subscription with items already in the box, and they exceed the maximums for the new subscription, they will be prompted to remove items from the box.

## Functionality:
[x] Selecting one of the options from the drop-down menu provides the Maximum Value and Maximum Volume information for that box <br />
[x] Selecting the + / - button for any item will increase or decrease the quantity by 1 <br />
[x] Increasing or decreasing the quantity will subtract from / add to the total available Value and Volume <br />


## Implementation:
[x] The loading of the page will trigger an external API call that will retrieve both the subscription and product JSON data, asynchronously <br />
[x] Selecting a box size will set the state for the volume and value limits through a callback function. <br />
[x] When the User selects the + / - buttons on individual products, the state will be updated for the remaining volume and value through callback functions <br />
[x] Every time the volume and value state is updated, IF any of the products exceed this limit in volume or value, their buttons will be deactivated <br />

## Extras:
[x] Warning message when button is deactivated (box is too full or no subscription chosen) <br />
[x] Testing scripts <br />
[ ] Box persists in local storage <br />
[ ] Optimized box - knapsack problem <br />
